* void phish_loop()
* void phish_probe(void (*probe)())
* int phish_recv()

continuous loop, waiting for input datums
if datum arrives on an input port, the port process() is called
if port is closed, the port done() is called
when all ports are closed, calls all_done callback, exits




same as phish_loop(), except that incoming datums are
  probed for in non-blocking manner
if no message is available,
  then probe() function in invoked so app can do more work





probe for incoming message, return whether one available or not
allows app to request messages explicitly, rather than thru
  phish_loop/probe and a callback
return 0 if no message
return 1 if done message (and invokes callbacks if necessary)
return N for # of fields in received message
