<H3>New Features and Bug Fixes in the MapReduce-MPI library 
</H3>
<P>This page lists new features and bug fixes in the MR-MPI library since
the current version was released.
</P>
<P>To add these features/fixes to your version of MR-MPI, download the
current tarball from the <A HREF = "../download.html">download page</A>, which
includes all the new features/fixes listed below, and rebuild the
code.
</P>
<P>The current version of MR-MPI is 15 March 2010.
</P>

<P><B>15 Mar 2010</B>
</P>
<P>New release of MR-MPI library.  7102 lines of code in src dir.
</P>
<P>The new version adds the following features:
</P>
<UL><LI>in-core operation when data sets fits in one "page" of memory
<LI>out-of-core operation otherwise
<LI>each processor writes to temporary disk files in out-of-core mode
<LI>user-settable size for a memory page via <A HREF = "doc/settings.html">memsize setting</A>
<LI>64-bit integer compatible data set sizes, enabling huge data sets 
</UL>
<P>See <A HREF = "doc/technical.html#ooc">this section of the documentation</A> for
further details on out-of-core operation.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "doc/technical.html#limits">this section of the documentation</A> for
a discussion of the (very large) limits on data set sizes that the
library can now process.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>1 Mar 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Final update to in-core version before releasing out-of-core version.
This upgrade just tweaks a few small cosmetic things.
</P>

Apr 2009 version.

<P><B>22 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>This upgrade adds 3 small features:
</P>
<P>1) A timer setting that enables output of timing info from each
library call.
</P>
<P>2) A new map() option to pass in an existing set of key/value pairs,
operate on them via the user's map function (one key/value at a time),
producing a new set of key/value pairs.  This is an alternative to
using the clone() method to turn the key/value pairs into
key/multivalue pairs and then perform a reduce() on them.
</P>
<P>3) Some clean-up inside the library of KeyValue and KeyMultiValue
objects when various calls transform data from one to the other.  This
should prevent users from invoking a call that uses an old KV or KMV
object that was already converted to something else by a previous
call.

<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.22Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 19
Apr 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>19 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Added some Makefiles for different machines and changed the C library
interface to the dummy MPI library, so that pure C programs can be
built with a C compiler instead of C++.  Ditto for the C examples
provided.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.19Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 18
Apr 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>18 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Added a dummy serial Pypar file to the examples dir, so that
the Python script examples can be run (in serial) even if
you don't have Pypar (Python wrapper on MPI) installed.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.18Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 17
Apr 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>17 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Enhanced the C++ and C word-frequency example programs to
read arbitrary sized text files (under 2 Gb).
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.17Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 16
Apr 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>16 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Restored some commented-out code in the examples/rmat.py Python
script.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.16Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 15
Apr 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>15 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>The Python wrapper files got accidentally whacked in the 14Apr09
upgrade due to a faulty script.  This upgrade restores them.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.15Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 14
Apr 2009 version.

<P><B>14 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Added an error check to the gather() function if proc count < 1
or proc count > actual procs.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.14Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 13
Apr 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>13 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Initial public release of MR-MPI.  3730 lines of code in src dir.
This version supercedes earlier distributed beta versions.
