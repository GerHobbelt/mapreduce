degree_stats command :h3

[Syntax:]

degree_stats dupflag -i in1 :pre

dupflag = 1/2 for counting edge once/twice
in1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL

[Examples:]

degree_stats 2 -i edges :pre

[Description:]

This is a named command which summarizes and prints out the degree
statistics of an undirected graph.  For each degree d, one line is
printed to the screen with the number of vertices of degree d.  This
is done in sorted order.

If the dupflag is 2, then each edge increments the degree of both of
its vertices.  If the dupflag is 1, then each edge only increments the
degree of the first of its vertices.  This can be useful if the graph
represents a sparse matrix and you want the statistics on non-zeroes
in each row of the matrix.

See the "named command"_command.html doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.

In1 stores a set of edges, assumed to have no duplicates or self
edges.  This means that either (Vi,Vj) or (Vj,Vi) appears, but not
both.  Also (Vi,Vi) does not appear.  The input is unchanged by this
command.

This command produces no output, other than what is written to the
screen.
