This is the MapReduce-MPI library, version 18 June 2008.

MapReduce is the operation popularized by Google for computing on
large distributed data sets.  See the Wikipedia entry on MapReduce for
details.

The MapReduce-MPI library is a simple, portable implementation of
MapReduce that runs on any serial desktop machine or large parallel
machine using MPI message passing.

As a user, you write a program which calls the MapReduce-MPI library
and you provide functions that operate on your data such as a map()
and a reduce().  These functions are invoked on single processors, so
that you typically do not need to write any parallel code to perform a
MapReduce.

The library is written in C++ and can be called from C++ or from C or
other hi-level languages (Fortran, scripting language, etc) thru the C
interface.  If you want to run on a single processor, a dummy MPI
library is provided to link against.  To perform MapReduces in
parallel, you need to link against an installed MPI library.
