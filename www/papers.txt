MapReduce-MPI Papers :h3

We have submitted a paper which describes the MR-MPI library
and several MapReudce graph algorithms for informatics problems:

[MapReduce in MPI for Large-Scale Graph Algorithms], Steven
J. Plimpton and Karen D. Devine, to a special issue of Parallel
Computing.  Hopefully it will appear early in 2011.

Until then, please cite the "MapReduce-MPI WWW site"_mws, if you use
the library in a paper.

The authors of the library are "Steve Plimpton"_sjp (sjplimp at
sandia.gov) and "Karen Devine"_kdd (kddevin at sandia.gov).

You can send us email regarding any of these issues:

If you use MR-MPI for something interesting, we'd like to hear about
it. :ulb,l

If you write a MapReduce program which calls the library, that others
would be interested in, you can send it and we'll include it in the
distribution. :l

If you enhance the library itself or have ideas for doing so, we can
discuss including the improvements in future releases. :l,ule
