\section{Performance Results}

  ideally, for each problem:
    define chosen characteristics of graph, e.g. edges/vertex
    choose 3 sizes:
      small = fits on 1 proc)
      medium = out-of-core on 1 proc, but not on P procs
      huge = impressive size
  show performance plots for each size running on 1 to P procs
    would like to see kink in plots as go out-of-core
    be able to judge and explain basic scaling results
  what machine: Odin or Tbird or RStorm?
    something that maps to a vanilla cluster
  where we have data:
    show multiple machines
    alternate non-MR algorithms
      discuss alternate CC algorithms via Trilinos and hybrid
    alternate MR implementations (Hadoop)
