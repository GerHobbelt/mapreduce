In this paper, we present two variations of a general analysis
algorithm for large datasets residing in distributed mem- ory
systems. Both variations avoid the need to move data among nodes
because they extract relevant data properties locally and concurrently
and transform the analysis problem (e.g., clustering or
classification) into a search for property aggregates. We test the two
variations using the SDSCâ€™s supercomputer Gordon, the MapReduce-MPI
library, and a structural biology dataset of 100 million
protein-ligand records. We evaluate both variations for their
sensitivity to data distribution and load imbalance. Our observations
indicate that the first variation is sensitive to data content and
distribution while the second variation is not. Moreover, the second
variation can self-heal load imbalance and it outperforms the first in
all the fifteen cases considered.
