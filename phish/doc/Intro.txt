1. Introduction :h3


PHISH has 2 parts: Python script (bait.py) and library (libphish.a)

what is streaming data
  continuous
  high bandwidth
  cannot afford to see it more than once

But can also process corpus of files.

Break stream up into datums = chunk of bytes.

Minnows read (swim in) stream, process datums,
can store state, consume or write (altered) datums.

Can wrap existing apps in PHISH (fish-wrapper).
Minnows are provided

School of minnows and their connectivity specified
in simple input script, processed with bait.py to
turn into launchable parallel job, either via MPI and
mpirun, or via sockets and a shell script.

easy path to distributed memory parallel for processing
streaming data

minnow = stand-alone program (app) that (typically)
does one task, designed to work in tandem with other
minnows, either copies of itself, or totally different

portable open-source lib, lightweight, easy to call
from any language, including Python

each stand-alone minnow calls library

difference between normal datum and "done" datum

explain acronym
  what each word means

minnow
school
input script
bait.py

school of minnows swim in a stream, doing something
coordinated.
