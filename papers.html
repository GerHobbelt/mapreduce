<P>If you use the MR-MPI library in one of your publications, please cite
the following paper and also list the URL of the <A HREF = "index.html">MR-MPI WWW
site</A>, namely http://mapreduce.sandia.gov.

<P>This paper describes the MR-MPI library and several MapReduce graph
algorithms for informatics problems:

<UL><LI>If you use MR-MPI for something interesting, we'd like to hear about
it. 

<LI>If you write a paper using the MR-MPI library, we can post a citation
to it on this page. 

<LI>If you write a MapReduce program which calls the library, that others
would be interested in, you can send it and we'll include it in the
distribution. 

<LI>If you enhance the library itself or have ideas for doing so, we can
discuss including the improvements in future releases.

<P>This is a paper by Seung-Jin Sul and Andrey Tovchigrechko (J Craig
Venter Institute) on using the MR-MPI library to parallelize two
computational biology algorithms: BLAST and a neural network approach
called SOM.  They've run their models successfully on up to 1024
processors of the U Texas Ranger machine.

<P>Ths is a paper by <A HREF = "http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~bzhang">Boyu Zhang</A> and
Michela Taufer (U Delaware) and collaborators who wrote two variants
of a general analysis algorithm for large structural biology datasets
requiring distributed memory.  The algorithm performance was evaluated
on 1024 cores across 15 data sets.
