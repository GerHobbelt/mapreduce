MapReduce kv_stats() method :h3
MapReduce kmv_stats() method :h3

void MapReduce::kv_stats(int level)
void MapReduce::kmv_stats(int level) :pre

Calling the kv_stats() method prints statistics about the KeyValue
object stored within the MapReduce object.  If level = 1 is specified,
a one-line summary is printed for all the key/value pairs across all
processors.  If a level = 2 is specified, per-processor information is
also printed in a one-line histogram format.

Calling the kmd_stats() method prints statistics about the
KeyMultiValue object stored within the MapReduce object.  If level = 1
is specified, a one-line summary is printed for all the
key/multi-value pairs across all processors.  If a level = 2 is
specified, per-processor information is also printed in a one-line
histogram format.
