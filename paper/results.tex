\section{Performance Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, we present performance results for the MapReduce
graph algorithms of the preceeding section, implemented as small C++
programs calling our MR-MPI library.

The benchmarks were run on a medium-sized Linux cluster.  Describe
Odin.

We ran each of the algorithms on 3 artificial R-MAT graphs of
different sizes, each on a varying number of processors.  The {\it
small} problem size (around 1M edges) was a problem that could be run
on a single processor.  The {\it medium} problem size (around 1B
edges) could be run on a few processors.  The {\it large} problem size
(around 1T edges) required most of the machine to run.

The resulting timings give a sense of the inherent scalability of the
MapReduce algorithms as graph size grows on a fixed number of
processors, and of the parallel scalability for computing on a graph
of fixed size on a growing number of processors.
