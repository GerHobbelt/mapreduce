<P>wrapper on phish_init() to allow calling from Python

<P>1st call that app makes, to initialize PHISH library
must be called before any other phish function

<P>looks for args of the following form and strips them off
note that -in and -out may appear multiple times in arg list
modifies narg and args to only have args that follow -args
