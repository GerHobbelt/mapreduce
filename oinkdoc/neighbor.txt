neighbor command :h3

[Syntax:]

neighbor -i input1 -o out1.file out1.mr :pre

input1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL
out1 = neighbors of each vertex: Key = Vi, Value = Vj Vk ... :ul

[Examples:]

degree -i mrv -o degree.list NULL

[Description:]

This is a named command which calculates the list of neighbors of each
vertex in an undirected graph.

See the "named command"_command.html doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.

Input1 stores a set of edges, assumed to have no duplicates or
self-edges.  The input is unchanged by this command.

A list of all the vertices each vertex shares an edge with is
calculated.  These are the first neighbors of each vertex.

Out1 will store the list of neighbor vertices for each vertex.  Thi
list is a single value in a key/value pair which is a vector of vertex
IDs, one after the other.
