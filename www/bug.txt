New Features and Bug Fixes in the MapReduce-MPI library :h3

This page lists new features and bug fixes in the MR-MPI library since
the current version was released.

To add these features/fixes to your version of MR-MPI, download the
current tarball from the "download page"_../download.html, which
includes all the new features/fixes listed below, and rebuild the
code.

The current version of MR-MPI is 13 April 0209.

This upgrade adds 3 small features:

1) A timer setting that enables output of timing info from each
library call.

2) A new map() option to pass in an existing set of key/value pairs,
operate on them via the user's map function (one key/value at a time),
producing a new set of key/value pairs.  This is an alternative to
using the clone() method to turn the key/value pairs into
key/multivalue pairs and then perform a reduce() on them.

3) Some clean-up inside the library of KeyValue and KeyMultiValue
objects when various calls transform data from one to the other.  This
should prevent users from invoking a call that uses an old KV or KMV
object that was already converted to something else by a previous
call.

Added some Makefiles for different machines and changed the C library
interface to the dummy MPI library, so that pure C programs can be
built with a C compiler instead of C++.  Ditto for the C examples
provided.

Added a dummy serial Pypar file to the examples dir, so that
the Python script examples can be run (in serial) even if
you don't have Pypar (Python wrapper on MPI) installed.
