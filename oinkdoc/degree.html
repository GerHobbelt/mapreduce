<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>degree -i input1 -o out1.file out1.mr 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>input1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL
<LI>out1 = degree of each vertex: Key = Vi, Value = degree 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>degree -i mrv -o degree.list NULL
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which calculates the degree of each vertex in
an undirected graph.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>Input1 stores a set of edges, assumed to have no duplicates or
self-edges.  The input is unchanged by this command.
</P>
<P>A count of the number of edges containing each vertex is calculated.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the degree count of each vertex.
