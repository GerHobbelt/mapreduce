Research highlights for
MapReduce in MPI for Large-scale Graph Algorithms
S. Plimpton and K. Devine

* We show how MapReduce operations can be performed on top of the
message-passing interface (MPI) in parallel and out-of-core, and
describe our open-source implementation, called the MR-MPI library.

* We describe MapReduce algorithms for several graph computations:
generation of random R-MAT graphs (or matrices), vertex ranking via
PageRank, triangle and connected-component finding, maximal
independent set identification, and single-source shortest-path.

* We give performance data for running these algorithms on graphs with
up to billions of edges.
