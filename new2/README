This directory contains my hacked version of out-of-core MR-MPI that 
overcomes segfaults and other problems when a single multivalue is 
extremely large.

I am checking this code into the repository so Steve can see it and compare
it with his revisions to mapreduce/new.  Eventually, this directory should
go away.

The major changes in this directory include the following:
-  many variables of type int are changed to type int64_t.
-  some variables of type int are changed to type uint64_t.
-  some unused variables are removed.
-  some size calculations are now changed based on data type changes.
