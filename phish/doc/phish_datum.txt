* int phish_datum(char **buf, int *len)

return info for entire received datum, including its field delimiters
buf = ptr to start of datum
len = byte length of entire datum, including field delimiters
also return input port message was received on

Using this call allows the minnow to do whatever it wishes with the
datum, including send it along intact to another minnow.  See
the phish_pack_datum() function.

This call does not conflict with the phish_unpack functions that
unpack the datum, field by field.  Those can still be used to process
the same datum.
