<H3>New Features and Bug Fixes in the MapReduce-MPI library 
</H3>
<P>This page lists new features and bug fixes in the MR-MPI library since
the current version was released.
</P>
<P>To add these features/fixes to your version of MR-MPI, download the
current tarball from the <A HREF = "../download.html">download page</A>, which
includes all the new features/fixes listed below, and rebuild the
code.
</P>
<P>The current version of MR-MPI is 13 April 0209.

<P><B>22 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>This upgrade adds 3 small features:
</P>
<P>1) A timer setting that enables output of timing info from each
library call.
</P>
<P>2) A new map() option to pass in an existing set of key/value pairs,
operate on by the user's map function (one key/value at a time),
producing a new set of key/value pairs.  This is an alternative to
using the clone() method as much to turn the key/value pairs into
key/multivalue pairs and perform a reduce() on them.
</P>
<P>3) Some clean-up inside the library of KeyValue and KeyMultiValue
objects when various calls transform data from one to the other.  This
should prevent users from invoking a call that uses an old KV or KMV
object that was already converted to something else by a previous
call.

<P><B>19 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Added some Makefiles for different machines and changed the C library
interface to the dummy MPI library, so that pure C programs can be
built with a C compiler instead of C++.  Ditto for the C examples
provided.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.19Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 18
Apr 2009 version.
</P>

<P><B>18 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Added a dummy serial Pypar file to the examples dir, so that
the Python script examples can be run (in serial) even if
you don't have Pypar (Python wrapper on MPI) installed.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.18Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 17
Apr 2009 version.
</P>

<P><B>17 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Enhanced the C++ and C word-frequency example programs to
read arbitrary sized text files (under 2 Gb).
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.17Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 16
Apr 2009 version.

script.

</P>

<P><B>15 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>The Python wrapper files got accidentally whacked in the 14Apr09
upgrade due to a faulty script.  This upgrade restores them.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.15Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 14

<P>Added an error check to the gather() function if proc count < 1
or proc count > actual procs.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.14Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 13
Apr 2009 version.
</P>

<P><B>13 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Initial public release of MR-MPI.  3730 lines of code in src dir.
