<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which finds all the triangles in an undirected
graph.  A triangle is a set of 3 vertices I,J,K for which the edges
IJ, JK, IK all exist.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in which
the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be specified.
</P>
<P>Input1 stores a set of edges, assumed to have no duplicates or
self-edges.  The input is unchanged by this command.
</P>
<P>The triangles are found via the MapReduce algorithm of
<A HREF = "#Cohen">(Cohen)</A> dicussed in his paper and in the paper of
<A HREF = "#Plimpton">(Plimpton)</A>.  Note that even small graphs can have large
numbers of triangles if there are very high-degree vertices.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the list of triangles.
