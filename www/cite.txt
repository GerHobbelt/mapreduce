Papers using the MapReduce-MPI library :h3

We're working on a couple of papers which implement MapReduce
algorithms for informatics problems, which will use the MR-MPI
library.  They'll be posted here when available.  Until then, please
cite the "MR-MPI WWW page"_mws, if you use the library in a paper.

The authors of the library are "Steve Plimpton"_sjp (sjplimp at
sandia.gov) and "Karen Devine"_kdd (kddevin at sandia.gov).

If you use MR-MPI for something interesting, we'd like to hear about
it. :ulb,l

If you write a MapReduce program which calls the library, that others
would be interested in, you can send it and we'll include it in the
distribution. :l

If you enhance the library itself or have ideas for doing so, we can
discuss including the improvements in future releases. :l,ule

You can send us email regarding any of these issues.
