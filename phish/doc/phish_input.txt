* void phish_input(int iport, void (*datumfunc)(int),
                   void (*donefunc)(), reqflag)

call once for each input port the app uses
cannot call after phish_check()

iport = port ID (0 to MAXPORT-1)
datumfunc = app function that will be called when a datum is recv by port,
            datumfunc(is passed the number of fields in the received datum
	    datumfunc can be NULL if don't wish to process datums
donefunc = app function that will be called when port is closed
             by receiving DONE messages from all senders
           donefunc can be NULL
reqflag = 1 if input port must be used by PHISH script, else 0

error if input script uses input port not setup by phish_input()
error if input script does not use a required port
OK if input script does not use a non-required port
