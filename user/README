This directory contains MapReduce programs written by users
which call the MapReduce-MPI library.

The Makefiles in this dir can be used to build one or more of the test
programs for various platforms.

test_cc.cpp	     connected components of a graph with distances
                     (Cohen's alg with distances)
test_ccnd.cpp        connected components of a graph 
                     (Cohen's alg without distances)
test_ccndtwo.cpp     connected components of a graph
                     (Modified Cohen's algorithm; collection of all
                     edges in a zone is split into two phases, with
                     each phase having up to P subzones per zone.)
ccnd.cpp             Function form of connected components algorithm without
                     distances; a flag indicates whether to do standard
                     Cohen's alg or modified Cohen's alg.
test_cc_nodist.cpp   Main program that calls ccnd.cpp.
test_gs.cpp	     global sum
test_matvec.cpp	     matrix-vector multiply of a sparse matrix
test_pagerank.cpp    PageRank on a sparse matrix
