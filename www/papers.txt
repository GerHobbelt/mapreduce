You can send us email regarding any of these issues:

If you use MR-MPI for something interesting, we'd like to hear about
it. :ulb,l

If you write a paper using the MR-MPI library, we can post a citation
to it on this page. :l

If you write a MapReduce program which calls the library, that others
would be interested in, you can send it and we'll include it in the
distribution. :l

If you enhance the library itself or have ideas for doing so, we can
discuss including the improvements in future releases. :l,ule
