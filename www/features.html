<H3>MapReduce-MPI library features and non-features 
</H3>
<UL><LI>open-source C++ library
<LI>C interface provided, thus callable from any hi-level language: C++, C, Fortran, scripting language, etc
<LI>Python wrapper provided, so MapReduce programs can be written in Python
<LI>small, portable code base
<LI>operates in serial or on any parallel platform that supports MPI 
</UL>
<UL><LI>no fault tolerance
<LI>no out-of-core capability 
</UL>
<P>Fault tolerance is really an MPI issue, which future versions of MPI
may address.  Since big parallel machines never crash, nor do their
processors die, hopefully it's a non-issue for performing MapReduce
operations.
</P>
<P>We plan to add an out-of-core capability to the MR-MPI library, though
the fact that many big parallel machines do not have a disk per
processor is a complicating factor.
