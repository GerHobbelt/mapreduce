<PRE>vertex_extract -i in1 -o out1.file out1.mr 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>in1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL
<LI>out1 = all vertices in graph: Key = Vi, Value = NULL 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which extracts a list of all the vertices
in a graph from the edge list.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of edges.  No assumption is made about duplicates or
self edges, i.e. (Vi,Vj) may appear multiple times, both (Vi,Vj) or
(Vj,Vi) may appear, as may (Vi,Vi).  The input is unchanged by this
command.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the vertices in the graph.
