degree command :h3

[Syntax:]

degree -i input1 -o out1.file out1.mr :pre

input1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL
out1 = degree of each vertex: Key = Vi, Value = degree :ul

[Examples:]

degree -i mrv -o degree.list NULL

[Description:]

This is a named command which calculates the degree of each vertex in
an undirected graph.

See the "named command"_command.html doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.

Input1 stores a set of edges, assumed to have no duplicates or
self-edges.  The input is unchanged by this command.

A count of the number of edges containing each vertex is calculated.

Out1 will store the degree count of each vertex.
