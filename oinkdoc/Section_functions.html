<H3>3. Adding Callback Functions to OINK 
</H3>
<P>In the oink directory, the files map_*.cpp, reduce_*.cpp,
compare_*.cpp, hash_*.cpp, and scan_*.cpp each contain one or more
functions which can be used as callback methods, passed to MR-MPI
library calls, such as the <A HREF = "doc/..map.html">map()</A> and
<A HREF = "../doc/reduce.html">reduce()</A> operations.  This can be done either in
<A HREF = "command.html">named commands</A> that you write, as described in <A HREF = "Section_commands.html">this
section</A> of the documention, or in <A HREF = "mrmpi.html">MR-MPI
library commands</A> made directly from an OINK input script.
</P>
<P>The collection of these files and callback functions is effectively a
library of tools that can be used by new <A HREF = "command.html">named commands</A>
or your input script to speed the development of new MapReduce
algorithms and workflows.  Over time, we intend to add new callback
function to OINK, and also invite users to send their own functions to
the developers for inclusion in OINK.
</P>
<P>The map(), reduce(), and scan() callback functions include a "void
*ptr" as a final argument, which the caller can pass to the callback.
This is typically done to enable the callback function to access
additional parameters stored by the caller.  When doing this with
functions listed in the map_*.cpp, reduce_*.cpp, and scan_*.cpp files
in OINK, you will want to make the data these pointers point to
"portable", so that and "named command" can use it.  Thus you would
should not typically encode class-specific or command-specific data in
the structure pointed to.  Instead, your caller should create the
minimial data structure that the callback function needs to operate,
and store the structure in a map_*.h file that corresponds to the
specific map_*.cpp file that contains the function (or reduce_*.h or
scan_*.h).  See the file oink/map_rmat.h file as an example.  It
contains the definition of an RMAT_params structure, which is used by
both the <A HREF = "rmat.txt">rmat command</A> and the map() methods it uses, listed
in map_rmat.cpp.  Both the rmap.cpp and map_rmat.cpp files include the
map_rmat.h header file to accomplish this.  Other commands or callback
functions could use the same data structure by including that header
file.
</P>
<P>The following sections list the various callback function currently
included in OINK, and a brief explanation of what each of them does.
</P>
<P>Note that map() functions come in 4 flavors, depending on what MR-MPI
library <A HREF = "../doc/map.html">map() method</A> is being used.  Similarly,
scan() functions come in 2 flavors, as documented on the <A HREF = "..doc/scan.html">scan()
method</A> page.  Map_*.cpp and scan_*.cpp files within
OINK can contain any of the 4 or 2 flavors of map() and scan()
methods.
</P>

<P>The documenation below this double line is auto-generated when the
OINK manual is created.  This is done by extracting C-style
documentation text from the map_*.cpp, reduce_*.cpp, compare_*.cpp,
hash_*.cpp, and scan_*.cpp files in the oink directory.  Thus you
should not edit content below this double line.
</P>
<P>In the *.cpp files in the oink directory, the lines between a line
with a "/*" and a line with a "*/" are extracted.  In the tables
below, the first such line of extracted text is assumed to be the
function name and appears in the left column.  The remaining lines
appear in the right columns.
