New Features and Bug Fixes in the MapReduce-MPI library :h3

This page lists new features and bug fixes in the MR-MPI library since
the current version was released.

To add these features/fixes to your version of MR-MPI, download the
current tarball from the "download page"_../download.html, which
includes all the new features/fixes listed below, and rebuild the
code.

The current version of MR-MPI is 15 March 2010.

Enhanced the "gather()"_doc/gather.html method so it should now work
with a "pagesize"_doc/settings.html larger than 2 Gb.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.11Jan11 from the 6
Jan 2011 version.

:line

[6 Jan 2011]

Added some new options to the "map()"_doc/map.html method to enable
lists of files or entire directories of files to be read in as part of
a map operation.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.6Jan11 from the 1
Nov 2010 version.

The print() function in the Python interface was causing some problems
with Python builds, likely because it is a keyword in Python.  This
patch renames the function.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.1Nov10 from the 26
Aug 2010 version.

Forgot to add the relevant doc page for the new
"broadcast()"_doc/broadcast.html method to the distribution.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.26Aug10 from the 25
Aug 2010 version.

:line

[25 Aug 2010]

Added a "broadcast()"_doc/broadcast.html method for spreading
key/value pairs across processors.  Can by useful for taking a final
"gathered"_doc/gather.html answer and distributing it for further
processing outside the MapReduce framework.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.25Aug10 from the 22
Apr 2010 version.

:line

[22 Apr 2010]

Added a compiler flag option for the "memsize and fpath" settings,
so that the default values of 64 Mbyte pages and the current
working directory can be overridden, if desired, when the
library is built.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.22Apr10 from the 15
Apr 2010 version.

:line

[16 Apr 2010]

Added "open()"_doc/open.html and "close()"_doc/open.html methods to
the MR-MPI library, to make it easy to have a single
"map()"_doc/map.html or "reduce()"_doc/reduce.html add key/value pairs
to multiple MapReduce objects.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Apr10 from the 14
Apr 2010 version.

:line

[15 Apr 2010]

Added an internal debug option to KeyMultiValue to make it
easier to test user reduce functions that work on multi-block
KMV pairs.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Apr10 from the 14
Apr 2010 version.

:line

[14 Apr 2010]

Added a "print()"_doc/print.html function to the library to print-out
KeyValue and KeyMultiValue pairs to the screen, useful for debugging.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Apr10 from the 15
Mar 2010 version.

:line

[15 Mar 2010]

New release of MR-MPI library.  7102 lines of code in src dir.

The new version adds the following features:

in-core operation when data sets fits in one "page" of memory
out-of-core operation otherwise
each processor writes to temporary disk files in out-of-core mode
user-settable size for a memory page via "memsize setting"_doc/settings.html
64-bit integer compatible data set sizes, enabling huge data sets :ul

See "this section of the documentation"_doc/technical.html#ooc for
further details on out-of-core operation.

See "this section of the documentation"_doc/technical.html#limits for
a discussion of the (very large) limits on data set sizes that the
library can now process.

:line

[1 Mar 2010]

Final update to in-core version before releasing out-of-core version.
This upgrade just tweaks a few small cosmetic things.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.1Mar10 from the 22
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[22 Apr 2009]

This upgrade adds 3 small features:

1) A timer setting that enables output of timing info from each
library call.

2) A new "map()"_doc/open.html_doc/open.html option to pass in an
existing set of key/value pairs, operate on them via the user's map
function (one key/value at a time), producing a new set of key/value
pairs.  This is an alternative to using the "clone()"_doc/clone.html
method to turn the key/value pairs into key/multivalue pairs and then
perform a reduce() on them.

3) Some clean-up inside the library of KeyValue and KeyMultiValue
objects when various calls transform data from one to the other.  This
should prevent users from invoking a call that uses an old KV or KMV
object that was already converted to something else by a previous
call.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.22Apr09 from the 19
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[19 Apr 2009]

Added some Makefiles for different machines and changed the C library
interface to the dummy MPI library, so that pure C programs can be
built with a C compiler instead of C++.  Ditto for the C examples
provided.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.19Apr09 from the 18
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[18 Apr 2009]

Added a dummy serial Pypar file to the examples dir, so that
the Python script examples can be run (in serial) even if
you don't have Pypar (Python wrapper on MPI) installed.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18Apr09 from the 17
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[17 Apr 2009]

Enhanced the C++ and C word-frequency example programs to
read arbitrary sized text files (under 2 Gb).

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.17Apr09 from the 16
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[16 Apr 2009]

Restored some commented-out code in the examples/rmat.py Python
script.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.16Apr09 from the 15
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[15 Apr 2009]

The Python wrapper files got accidentally whacked in the 14Apr09
upgrade due to a faulty script.  This upgrade restores them.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Apr09 from the 14
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[14 Apr 2009]

Added an error check to the gather() function if proc count < 1
or proc count > actual procs.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Apr09 from the 13
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[13 Apr 2009]

Initial public release of MR-MPI.  3730 lines of code in src dir.
This version supercedes earlier distributed beta versions.
