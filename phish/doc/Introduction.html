<P>PHISH has 2 parts: Python script (bait.py) and library (libphish.a)
</P>
<P>what is streaming data
  continuous
  high bandwidth
  cannot afford to see it more than once
</P>
<P>But can also process corpus of files.
</P>
<P>Break stream up into datums = chunk of bytes.
</P>
<P>Minnows read (swim in) stream, process datums,
can store state, consume or write (altered) datums.
</P>
<P>Can wrap existing apps in PHISH (fish-wrapper).
Minnows are provided
</P>
<P>School of minnows and their connectivity specified
in simple input script, processed with bait.py to
turn into launchable parallel job, either via MPI and
mpirun, or via sockets and a shell script.
</P>
<P>easy path to distributed memory parallel for processing
streaming data
</P>
<P>minnow = stand-alone program (app) that (typically)
does one task, designed to work in tandem with other
minnows, either copies of itself, or totally different
</P>
<P>portable open-source lib, lightweight, easy to call
from any language, including Python
</P>
<P>each stand-alone minnow calls library
</P>
<P>difference between normal datum and "done" datum
</P>
<P>explain acronym
  what each word means
</P>
<P>minnow
school
input script
bait.py
</P>
<P>school of minnows swim in a stream, doing something
coordinated.
