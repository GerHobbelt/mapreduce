As explained above, this MR-MPI library is licensed under the
"Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) License"_bsd.  This basically
means it can be used by anyone for any purpose, including commercial
ones.

If you use the MR-MPI library for something interesting, we'd like to
hear about it.

If you write a MapReduce program which calls the library, that others
would be interested in, you can send it and we'll include it in the
distribution.

If you enhance the MR-MPI library itself or have ideas for doing so,
we can discuss including the improvements in future releases.

You can send the authors email regarding any of these issues.
