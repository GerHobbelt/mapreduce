<A NAME = "align"></A><H4>Length and byte-alignment of keys and values 
</H4>
<P>As explained in <A HREF = "program.html">this section</A>, keys and values are
variable-length strings of bytes.  The MR-MPI library knows nothing of
their contents and simply treats them as contiguous chunks of bytes.
</P>
<P>When you register a key and value in your <A HREF = "map.html">mymap()</A> or
<A HREF = "compress.html">mycompress()</A> or <A HREF = "reduce.html">myreduce()</A> function via
the KeyValue <A HREF = "kv_add.html">add()</A> method, you specify their lengths in
bytes.  Keys and values are typically returned to your program for
further processing or output, e.g. as arguments passed to your
myreduce() function by the <A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A> operation, as are
their lengths.
</P>
<P>Keys and values are passed as character pointers to your functions
where you may need to convert the pointer to an appropriate data type
and then correctly interpret the byte string.  For example, either of
these lines could be used:
</P>
<PRE>int *iptr = (int *) key;
int myvalue = *((int *) key); 
</PRE>
<P>If the key or value is a variable-length text string, you may want to
terminate it with a "0", and include the trailing "0" in the byte
count, so that C-library-style string functions can later be invoked
on it.  If a key or value is a complex data structure, your function
must be able to decode it.
</P>
<P>A related issue with keys and values is the byte-alignment of integer
or floating point values they include.  For example, it is usually a
bad idea to store an 8-byte double such that it is mis-aligned with
respect to an 8-byte boundary in memory.  The reason is that using a
mis-aligned double in a computation may be slow.
</P>
<P>If your keys or values are homogeneous (e.g. all integers), you can
use the <I>keyalign</I> and <I>valuealign</I> settings, discussed
<A HREF = "settings.html">here</A>, to insure alignment of keys and values to
desired byte boundaries.  Since this may incur extra memory costs, you
should typically not make these settings larger than needed.
</P>
<P>Special care may need to be taken if your values are heterogeneous.
This is because the MR-MPI library packs values one after the other
into one long byte string when it is returned to your program as a
multi-value, e.g. as an argument to the callback of a "reduce()"
method.  Only the first value in the multi-value is aligned to the
<I>valuealign</I> <A HREF = "settings.html">setting</A>.  Similarly, the
<A HREF = "collapse.html">collapse()</A> method creates a multi-value that is
sequence of key,value,key,value,etc from a KV.  If the keys are
variable-length text strings and the values are integers, then the
values will not be aligned on 4-byte boundaries.
</P>
<P>Here are two ideas that can be used to insure alignment of heterogeneous data:
</P>
<P>(a) Say your "value" is a 4-byte integer followed by an 8-byte double.
You might think it can be stored and registered as 12 contiguous
bytes.  However, this would likely mean the double is mis-aligned.
One solution is to convert the integer to a double before storing both
quantities in a 16-byte value string.  Another solution is to create a
struct to store the integer and double and use the sizeof() function
to determine the length of the struct and use that as the length of
your "value".  The compiler should then guarantee proper alignment of
each structure member.
</P>
<P>(b) Your callback function can always copy the bytes of a key or value
into a local data structure with the proper alignment, e.g. using the
C memcpy() function.  E.g. in the collapse example above, these lines
of code:
</P>
<PRE>int myvalue;
memcpy(&myvalue,&multivalue[offset],sizeof(int)); 
</PRE>
<P>would load the 4 bytes of a particular value (at location offset) in
the multi-value into the local integer "myvalue", where it can then be
used for computation.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "memory"></A><H4>Memory requirements for KeyValue and KeyMultiValue objects 
</H4>
<P>KeyValue and KeyMultiValue objects are described in <A HREF = "interface_c++.html">this
section</A>.  A MapReduce object contains a single
KeyValue object (KV) or a single KeyMultiValue object (KMV), depending
on which methods you have invoked.
</P>
<P>The memory cost for storing key/value pairs in a KV is as follows.
The key and value each have a byte length.  Two integers are also
stored for the key and value length.  There may also be additional
bytes added to align the key and value on byte boundaries in memory;
see the <I>keyalign</I> and <I>valuealign</I> settings, discussed in <A HREF = "settings.html">this
section</A>.  Thus the total size of a KV is the memory for
the key/value datums plus 2 integers per pair plus any extra alignment
bytes.
</P>
<P>Recall that a KMV contains key/multi-value pairs where the number of
pairs is typically the number of unique keys in the original KV.  The
memory cost for storing key/multi-value pairs in a KMV is as follows.
The key and multi-value each have a byte length.  For the multi-value,
this is the sum of individual value lengths.  Again, there may also be
additional bytes added to align the key and multi-value on byte
boundaries in memory; see the <I>keyalign</I> and <I>valuealign</I> settings,
discussed in <A HREF = "settings.html">this section</A>.  Three integers are also
stored: the key and multi-value length, and the number of values N in
the multi-value.  An N-length integer array is also stored for the
length of each value in the multi-value.  Thus the total size of a KMV
is the memory for the key/multi-value datums plus 3 integers per pair
plus 1 integer per value in the multi-value plus any extra alignment
bytes.
</P>
<P>Note that memory for key data in a KMV is typically less than in the
original KV, since the KMV only stores unique keys.  The memory for
multi-value data is the same as the value data in the original KV,
since all the KV values are contained in the multi-values.
</P>
<P>Note that in parallel, for a KV or KMV, each processor stores the
above data only for the fraction of key/value pairs it generated
during a <A HREF = "map.html">map()</A> operation or acquired during other
operations, like a <A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A>.  If this is imbalanced,
one processor may own and process datums more than other processors.
</P>
<P>If KV or KMV data on a processor exceeds the <I>memsize</I> setting,
discussed <A HREF = "settings.html">here</A>, then data is written to temporary disk
files, on a per-processor basis.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "ooc"></A><H4>Out-of-core operation 
</H4>
<P>All the MR-MPI methods can be invoked on data sets larger than fit in
the aggregate memory of the processors being used.  When the data on
any single processor exceeds its local memory limit, as set by the
<I>memsize</I> <A HREF = "settings.html">setting</A>, that processor will write data to a
temporary disk file, and later read it back in.
</P>
<P>For many data sets and MapReduce operations, the out-of-core
capability of the MR-MPI library means you can effectively process
arbitrarily large data sets.  To first order, you can think of the
<I>memsize</I> setting as a hard limit on the amount of memory a processor
will use during any MR-MPI operation.  However, there are 4 caveats.
The first 3 may be overcome in future versions of the MR-MPI library.
</P>
<P>(1) The <A HREF = "convert.html">convert()</A> portion of a <A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A>
operation performs an on-processor reorganization of the data in a KV
to produce a KMV.  For large data sets this requires breaking up a
disk file of data into smaller files, so that each holds data that
will contribute to one chunk of the eventual KMV file.  Each smaller
file requires an in-memory buffer to store data that is written/read
to/from the file.  Since it is hard to predict how many smaller files
will be needed, the allocation of these buffers is done on-the-fly,
using extra memory beyond the <I>memsize</I> allocation.  If a large number
of small files is needed, it's possible these extra buffers will
exceed available memory, which will generate an error.
</P>
<P>(2) The <A HREF = "aggregate.html">aggregate()</A> portion of a
<A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A> operation migrates data between processors.
The MPI_Send() and MPI_Recv() functions from the MPI library that do
this, use additional memory behind the scenes for message buffering.
Since the MR-MPI library pre-posts receives for large messages, this
additional memory overhead should generally be small.  One exception
is the case where one (or a few) processors will end up holding the
majority of KV data at the end of the <A HREF = "aggregate.html">aggregate()</A>
operation.  The processor needs to pre-allocate a large buffer to
receive all the incoming data.  Once received, the data will be
written to disk and the memory de-allocated.  But if the temporary
receive buffer cannot be allocated out of the <I>memsize</I> chunk, it
requires an extra allocation.  If this exceeds available memory, an
error is generated.
</P>
<P>Note that if the data aggregation is so imbalanced that this memory
issue arises, then even if the <A HREF = "aggregate.html">aggregate()</A> completes,
it may mean subsequent MapReduce operations, such as a
<A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A>, will likely by load-imbalanced and perform
poorly in a parallel sense.  So you may want to rethink how your
key/value data is organized and partitioned across processors.
</P>
<P>(3) As discussed <A HREF = "settings.html">here</A>, a <I>memsize</I> setting of N Mbytes
means that KV or KMV files are written in N/4 size chunks.  Currently,
this requires that a single key/value or key/multi-value pair within a
KV or KMV must fit in one chunk.  This is typically not an issue for
key/value pairs, but may be for key/multi-value pairs.  For example,
if <I>memsize</I> is the default 100 Mbytes, then a single key/multi-value
pair cannot be larger than 25 Mbytes.  This includes the unique key
and all its values, as well as the integer array of value lengths.
Thus, in this example, even if values were of length 0, there could be
no more than about 6.25 million of them associated with a single key
(6.25 million integers for the length array).  If this limit is
exceeded, an error is generated.
</P>
<P>(4) There are numerous additional small allocations of memory made by
the MR-MPI library.  E.g. the out-of-core disk files are stored as
"pages" of data.  Each page requires some in-memory bookkeeping so it
can be written and read.  Thus if a file grows to 1000s of pages, the
corresponding in-memory bookkeeping structure will also become larger.
For normal <I>memsize</I> settings, e.g. the 100 Mbyte default, these
additional in-memory allocations should be small compared to the
<I>memsize</I> allocation.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "hash"></A><H4>Hash functions 
</H4>
<P>The <A HREF = "convert.html">convert()</A> and <A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A> methods use
a hash function to organize keys and find duplicates.  The MR-MPI
library uses the hashlittle() function from lookup3.c, written by Bob
Jenkins and available freely on the WWW.  It operates on
arbitrary-length byte strings (a key) and produces a 32-bit integer
hash value, a portion of which is used as a bucket index into a hash
table.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "callback"></A><H4>Callback functions 
</H4>
<P>Several of the library methods take a callback function as an
argument, meaning that function is called back to from the library
when the method is invoked.  These functions are part of your
MapReduce program and can perform any operation you wish on your data
(or on no data), so long as they produce the appropriate information.
E.g. they generate key/value pairs in the case of <A HREF = "map.html">map()</A> or
<A HREF = "compress.html">compress()</A> or <A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A>, or they hash a
key to a processor in the case of <A HREF = "aggregate.html">aggregate()</A> or
<A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A>, or they compare two keys or values in the
case of <A HREF = "sort_key.html">sort_keys()</A> or
<A HREF = "sort_values.html">sort_values()</A>.
</P>
<P>The mymap() and myreduce() functions can perform simple operations or
very complex, compute-intensive operations.  For example, if your
parallel machine supports it, they could invoke another program or
script to read/parse an input file or calculate some result.
</P>
<P>Note that in your program, a callback function CANNOT be a class
method unless it is declared to be "static".  It can also be a
non-class method, i.e. just a stand-alone function.  In either case,
such a function cannot access class data.
</P>
<P>One way to get around this restriction is to define global variables
that allow your function to access information it needs.
</P>
<P>Another way around this restriction is to use the feature provided by
several of the library methods with callback function arguments which
allow you to pass in a pointer to whatever data you wish.  This
pointer is returned as an argument when the callback is made.  This
pointer should be cast to (void *) when passed in, and your callback
function can later cast it back to the appropriate data type.  For
example, a class could set the pointer to an array or an internal data
structure or the class itself as "(void *) this".  Specify a NULL if
your function doesn't need the pointer.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "python"></A><H4>Python overhead 
</H4>
<P>Using the MR-MPI library from Python incurs two not-so-obvious
overheads beyond the usual slowdown due to using an interpreted
language.  First, Python objects used as keys and values are "pickled"
and "unpickled" using the cPickle Python library when passed into and
out of the C++ library.  This is because the library stores them as
byte strings.  The pickling process serializes a Python object
(e.g. an integer, a string, a tuple, or a list) into a byte stream in
a way that it can be unpickled into the same Python object.
</P>
<P>The second overhead is due to the complexity of making a double
callbacks between the library and your Python script.  I.e. the
library calls back once to the user program which then calls back into
the library.  Consider what happens during a map() operation when the
library is called from a C++ program.
</P>
<UL><LI>the program calls the library map() method
<LI>the library map() calls back to the user map() callback function
<LI>the user map() calls the library add() method to register a key/value pair 
</UL>
<P>When doing this from Python there are 3 additional layers between the
Python program and the library, the Python mrmpi class, an invisible C
layer (created by ctypes), and the C interface on the C++ library
itself.  Thus the callback operation proceeds as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>the program calls the mrmpi class map() method
<LI>the mrmpi class map() calls the invisible C map() function
<LI>the invisible map() calls the C interface map() function
<LI>the C interface map() calls the library map() method
<LI>the library map() calls back to the invisible C callback function
<LI>the invisible callback calls the mrmpi class callback method
<LI>the mrmpi callback calls the user map() callback function
<LI>the user map() calls the mrmpi class add() method to register a key/value pair
<LI>the mrmpi class add() calls the invisible C add() function
<LI>the invisible add() calls the C interface add() function
<LI>the C interface add() calls the library add() method 
</UL>
<P>Thus 3 calls have become 11 due to the 3 additional layers data must
pass through.  Some of these pass throughs are very simple, but others
require massaging and copying of data, like the pickling/unpickling
described above, which occurs in the mrmpi class methods.  I was
somewhat surprised this double-callback sequence works as well and as
transparently as it does - Python ctypes is amazing!
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "error"></A><H4>Error messages 
</H4>
<P>The error messages printed out by the MR-MPI library are hopefully
self-explanatory.  At some point they will be listed in these doc
pages.
</P>
