<H3>MapReduce-MPI Papers 
</H3>
<P>We're working on a couple of papers which implement MapReduce
algorithms for informatics problems, using the MR-MPI library.
They'll be posted here when available.  Until then, please cite the
<A HREF = "../mapreduce.html">MapReduce-MPI WWW site</A>, if you use the library in a paper.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The authors of the library are <A HREF = "sjp">Steve Plimpton</A> (sjplimp at
sandia.gov) and <A HREF = "kdd">Karen Devine</A> (kddevin at sandia.gov).
</P>
<P>You can send us email regarding any of these issues:
</P>
<UL><LI>If you use MR-MPI for something interesting, we'd like to hear about
it. 

<LI>If you write a MapReduce program which calls the library, that others
would be interested in, you can send it and we'll include it in the
distribution. 

<LI>If you enhance the library itself or have ideas for doing so, we can
discuss including the improvements in future releases.
