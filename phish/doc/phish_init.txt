[Python syntax:]

void phish_init(int *pnarg, char ***pargs)
int phish_school(int *pme, int *pnminnows)

[Python examples:]

printf("Minnow info: %d %d\n",me,nminnows);

[Description:]

These are PHISH library functions which can be called from a minnow
application.  In PHISH lingo, a "minnow" is a stand-alone application
which makes calls to the "PHISH library"_Library.html.

The phish_init() function is the first call to the PHISH library that
a minnow makes and it must be made before any other PHISH library call
can be made.  Typically, it the first executable line of a minnow
program.

It's purpose is to initialize the library using command-line arguments
that were passed to the minnow when it was launched, typically by the
MPI or socket launch script that the "bait.py"_Bait.html setup tool
creates from a PHISH input script.

When a PHISH program, using one or more sets of minnows is launched,
every individual minnow is assigned a global ID, from 0 to G-1, where
{G} = the total number of minnows.  These IDs are ordered by group, so
that the minnows in each set have consecutive IDs.  These IDs enable
the PHISH library to orchestrate communication of datums between
minnows in different sets.

The two arguments to phish_init() are pointers to the number of
command-line arguments, and a pointer to the arguments themselves as
an array of strings.  These are passed as pointers, because the PHISH
library will read and remove the PHISH-specific arguments.  It will
then return the reamining minnow-specific arguments, which the minnow
can read and process.

There are the switches and arguments the PHISH library looks for and
processes:

-app exefile ID N Nprev 
-in sprocs sfirst sport style rprocs rfirst rport
-out sprocs sfirst sport style rprocs rfirst rport
-args arg1 arg2 ... = args for the minnoq itself :ul

The {-app} switch appears once, as the first argument.  {Exefile} is
the name of executable file for this minnow, e.g. count or count.py.
The ID is its minnow ID in the PHISH input script.  {N} is the number
of duplicate minnows launched via the "layout"_bait_layout.html
command and the "bait.py"_Bait.html tool.  {Nprev} is how many of the
duplicate minnows precede this one in this set of duplicate minnows.
E.g. if {N} = 10 minnows were launched in this set, each of them would
be assigned an {Nprev} from 0 to 9.

NOTE: is Nprev within the set, or a global ID?

The {-in} switch appears once for every connection the minnow has with
other minnows, where it is a receiver of datums.  See the
"connect"_bait_connect.html command in PHISH input scripts processed
by the "bait.py"_Bait.html tool, for more information.

{Sprocs}, {sfirst}, and {sport} refer to the set of minnows sending to
this minnow.  They are respectively, the number of minnows in the set,
the global ID of the first minnow in the set, and the output port used
by those minnows.  {Rprocs}, {rfirst}, and {rport} refer to the set of
minnows receivng the datums, i.e. the set of minnows this minnow
belongs to.  They are respectively, the number of minnows in the set,
the global ID of the first minnow in the set, and the input port used
by those minnows.  {Style} is the connection style, as specified by
the "connect"_bait_connect.html command in the PHISH input script
processed by the "bait.py"_Bait.html tool.  E.g. {style} is a word
like "single" or "hashed".  If it is "subscribe", then extra info
about the external host and its TCP port is appended to the {style},
e.g. "subscribe/www.foo.com:25".

The {-out} switch appears once for every connection the minnow has
with other minnows, where it is a sender of datums.  See the
"connect"_bait_connect.html command in PHISH input scripts processed
by the "bait.py"_Bait.html tool, for more information.

{Sprocs}, {sfirst}, and {sport} refer to the set of minnows sending
datums, i.e. the set of minnows this minnow belongs to.  They are
respectively, the number of minnows in the set, the global ID of the
first minnow in the set, and the output port used by those minnows.
{Rprocs}, {rfirst}, and {rport} refer to the set of minnows receivng
the datums.  They are respectively, the number of minnows in the set,
the global ID of the first minnow in the set, and the input port used
by those minnows.  {Style} is the connection style, as specified by
the "connect"_bait_connect.html command in the PHISH input script
processed by the "bait.py"_Bait.html tool.  E.g. {style} is a word
like "single" or "hashed".  If it is "publish", then extra info about
the TCP port is appended to the {style}, e.g. "publish/25".

The {-args} switch appears last and lists all the remaining
minnow-specific arguments.  The PHISH library ignores these, but
strips of all command-line arguments up to and including the {-args}
switch before returning the args to the minnow caller.

The phish_init() function also flags each specified input port and
output port with a CLOSED status, instead of UNUSED.  See the
"connect"_bait_connect.html command for the "bait.py"_Bait.html tool
for more info about communication ports.  See the
"phish_input"_phish_input.html and "phish_output"_phish_output.html
functions for more info about port status.

:line

The phish_school() function can be used to query information about the
minnow's status within the school (or collection) of minnows running
the PHISH program.

The returned "me" and "nminnows" are the global ID of this
minnow and the total number of minnows ({G} as described above).

The function itself returns the MPI communicator being used by PHISH
(i.e. MPI_COMM_WORLD), when running the MPI version of the library.

NOTE: what is communicator for socket version?

NOTE: should it also return number of minnows in this set?
      or my location within the set?
