<H3>Contributing to the MapReduce-MPI library and OINK 
</H3>
<P>In the spirit of an open-source code, there are various ways you can

better.  You can send email on any of these items to the developers
listed on the <A HREF = "../mapreduce.html">MR-MPI WWW site</A>.

or scan() functions which we can add to the OINK source code, as
