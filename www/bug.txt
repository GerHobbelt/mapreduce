New Features and Bug Fixes in the MapReduce-MPI library :h3

This page lists new features and bug fixes in the MR-MPI library since
the current version was released.

To add these features/fixes to your version of MR-MPI, download the
current tarball from the "download page"_../download.html, which
includes all the new features/fixes listed below, and rebuild the
code.

The current version of MR-MPI is 15 March 2010.

Added an internal debug option to KeyMultiValue to make it
easier to test user reduce functions that work on multi-block
KMV pairs.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Apr10 from the 14
Apr 2010 version.

Added a "print"_doc/print.html function to the library to print-out
KeyValue and KeyMultiValue pairs to the screen, useful for debugging.

Mar 2010 version.

[15 Mar 2010]

New release of MR-MPI library.  7102 lines of code in src dir.

The new version adds the following features:

in-core operation when data sets fits in one "page" of memory
out-of-core operation otherwise
each processor writes to temporary disk files in out-of-core mode
user-settable size for a memory page via "memsize setting"_doc/settings.html
64-bit integer compatible data set sizes, enabling huge data sets :ul

See "this section of the documentation"_doc/technical.html#ooc for
further details on out-of-core operation.

See "this section of the documentation"_doc/technical.html#limits for
a discussion of the (very large) limits on data set sizes that the
library can now process.

Final update to in-core version before releasing out-of-core version.
This upgrade just tweaks a few small cosmetic things.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.1Mar10 from the 22
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[22 Apr 2009]

This upgrade adds 3 small features:

1) A timer setting that enables output of timing info from each
library call.

2) A new map() option to pass in an existing set of key/value pairs,
operate on them via the user's map function (one key/value at a time),
producing a new set of key/value pairs.  This is an alternative to
using the clone() method to turn the key/value pairs into
key/multivalue pairs and then perform a reduce() on them.

3) Some clean-up inside the library of KeyValue and KeyMultiValue
objects when various calls transform data from one to the other.  This
should prevent users from invoking a call that uses an old KV or KMV
object that was already converted to something else by a previous
call.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.22Apr09 from the 19
Apr 2009 version.

[19 Apr 2009]

Added some Makefiles for different machines and changed the C library
interface to the dummy MPI library, so that pure C programs can be
built with a C compiler instead of C++.  Ditto for the C examples
provided.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.19Apr09 from the 18
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[18 Apr 2009]

Added a dummy serial Pypar file to the examples dir, so that
the Python script examples can be run (in serial) even if
you don't have Pypar (Python wrapper on MPI) installed.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18Apr09 from the 17
Apr 2009 version.

[17 Apr 2009]

Enhanced the C++ and C word-frequency example programs to
read arbitrary sized text files (under 2 Gb).

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.17Apr09 from the 16
Apr 2009 version.

[16 Apr 2009]

Restored some commented-out code in the examples/rmat.py Python
script.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.16Apr09 from the 15
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[15 Apr 2009]

The Python wrapper files got accidentally whacked in the 14Apr09
upgrade due to a faulty script.  This upgrade restores them.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Apr09 from the 14
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[14 Apr 2009]

Added an error check to the gather() function if proc count < 1
or proc count > actual procs.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Apr09 from the 13
Apr 2009 version.

:line

[13 Apr 2009]

Initial public release of MR-MPI.  3730 lines of code in src dir.
This version supercedes earlier distributed beta versions.
