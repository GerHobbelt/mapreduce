<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>rmat N Nz a b c d fraction seed -o out1.file out1.mr 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>N = order of matrix, 2^N = number of rows in matrix
<LI>Nz = average # of non-zeroes per row, Nz * 2^N = total # of non-zeroes
<LI>a,b,c,d = RMAT parameters which sum to 1.0
<LI>fraction = RMAT twiddle factor
<LI>seed = random number seed (positive integer)
<LI>out1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Generate a sparse random matrix via the rules defined for RMAT
matrices, as discussed in the paper by <A HREF = "#Christoff">(Christoff)</A>.  Such
matrices are often used to represent graphs where the vertices are
numbered 1 to Nrows, and the non-zero matrix entries represent edges.
The number of rows and non-zero entries are determined by the
specified <I>N</I> and <I>Nz</I> arguments.
</P>
<P>Depending on the choice of the RMAT parameters the degree distribution
of the resulting graph can be roughly uniform or highly skewed, which
is useful in modeling different kind of graphs, e.g. Internet
connectivity.  The a,b,c,d parameters must sum to 1.0 and represent
weighting for the 4 different quadrants of the matrix.  As non-zero
entries are generated, they are assigned to each quadrant in a
recursive manner using the a,b,c,d weightings and a random number
generator.  A fraction value of 0.0 means the a,b,c,d weightings are
used as-is.  A fraction value > 0.0 but < 1.0 means the weightings
are randomly twiddled at each iteration of the recursion.
</P>
<P>The MapReduce algorithm for performing the RMAT generation is
described in the paper by <A HREF = "#Plimpton">(Plimpton)</A>.  This rmat command
implements the first of the two algorithms in the Plimpton and Devine
paper.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>This command takes no inputs via the "-i" argument for <A HREF = "command.html">named
commands</A>.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the list of edges of the resultig RMAT graph, or
equivalently, the I,J indices of non-zeroes in the matrix.  There will
be exactly Nz * 2^N entries in out1.  This may include some self-edges
(I,I) and duplicate edges (I,J and J,I both appear).  If desired,
these can be removed by further processing.
