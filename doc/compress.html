<H3>MapReduce compress() method 
</H3>
<H3>MapReduce multivalue_blocks() method 
</H3>
<H3>MapReduce multivalue_block() method 
</H3>
<PRE>int MapReduce::compress(void (*mycompress)(char *, int, char *, int, int *, KeyValue *, void *), void *ptr) 
</PRE>
<PRE>int MapReduce::multivalue_blocks() 
</PRE>
<PRE>int MapReduce::multivalue_block(int iblock, char **ptr_multivalue, int **ptr_valuesizes) 
</PRE>
<P>This calls the compress() method of a MapReduce object, which
compresses a KeyValue object with duplicate keys into a new KeyValue
object, where each key appears once (on that processor) and has a
single new value.  The new value is a combination of the values
associated with that key in the original KeyValue object.  The
mycompress() function you provide generates the new value.  The method
returns the total number of key/value pairs in the new KeyValue
object.
</P>
<P>This method is used to compress a large set of key/value pairs
produced by the <A HREF = "map.html">map()</A> method into a smaller set before
proceeding with the rest of a MapReduce operation, e.g. with a
<A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A> and <A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A>.
</P>
<P>You can give this method a pointer (void *ptr) which will be returned
to your mycompress() function.  See the <A HREF = "technical.html">Technical
Details</A> section for why this can be useful.  Just
specify a NULL if you don't need this.
</P>
<P>In this example the user function is called mycompress() and it must
have the following interface, which is the same as that used by the
<A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A> method:
</P>
<PRE>void mycompress(char *key, int keybytes, char *multivalue, int nvalues, int *valuebytes, KeyValue *kv, void *ptr) 
</PRE>
<P>A single key/multi-value pair is passed to your function from a
temporary KeyMultiValue object created by the library.  That object
creates a multi-value for each unique key in the KeyValue object which
contains a list of the nvalues associated with that key.  Note that
this is only the values on this processor, not across all processors.
</P>
<P>In this case, the char *multivalue argument is a pointer to the
beginning of the multi-value which contains all nvalues, packed one
after the other.  The int *valuebytes argument is an array which
stores the length of each value in bytes.  If needed, it can be used
by your function to compute an offset into char *values for where each
individual value begins.  Your function is also passed a kv pointer to
a new KeyValue object created and stored internally by the MapReduce
object.
</P>
<P>If the values do not fit in memory, then the meaning of the arguments
passed to your function is changed.  Your function must call two
additional library functions in order to retrieve a block of values
that does fit in memory, and process them one block at a time.
</P>
<P>In this case, the char *multivalue argument will be NULL, which is how
your function can test for this possibility.  If you know huge
multi-values will not occur or if you don't need to examine the values
themselves, then the test is not needed.  Nvalues still holds the
total number of values in the multi-value.  The meaning of the kv and
ptr arguments is the same as discussed above.  However, the int
*valuebytes argument is changed to be a pointer to the MapReduce
object.  This is to allow you to make the following two kinds of calls
back to the library:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *mr = (MapReduce *) valuebytes;
int nblocks = mr->multivalue_blocks();
for (int iblock = 0; iblock < nblocks; iblock++) <I> 
  int nv = mr->multivalue_block(iblock,&multivalue,&valuebytes);
  for (int i = 0; i < nv; i++) <I>
    process each value within the block of values
  </I>
</I> 
</PRE>
<P>The call to multivalue_blocks() returns the number of blocks of values
in the multi-value.  Each call to multivalue_block() retrieves one
block of values.  The number of values in the block (nv in this case)
is returned.  The multivalue and valuebytes arguments are pointers to
a char * and int * (i.e. a char ** and int **), which will be set to
point to the block of values and their lengths respectively, so they
can then be used just as the multivalue and valuebytes arguments in
the mycompress() callback itself (when the values do not exceed
available memory).
</P>
<P>Note that in this example we are re-using (and thus overwriting) the
original multivalue and valuebytes arguments as local variables.
</P>
<P>Also note that your mycompress() function can call multivalue_block()
as many times as it wishes and process the blocks of values multiple
times or in any order, though looping through blocks in ascending
order will typically give the best disk I/O performance.
</P>
<P>Your mycompress() function should typicaly produce a single key/value
pair which it registers with the MapReduce object by calling the
<A HREF = "kv_add.html">add()</A> method of the KeyValue object.  The syntax for
this call is described on the doc page for the KeyValue
<A HREF = "kv_add.html">add()</A> methd.  For example, if the set of nvalues were
integers, the compressed value might be the sum of those integers.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "settings.html">Settings</A> and <A HREF = "technical.html">Technical
Details</A> sections for details on the byte-alignment of
keys and values that are passed to your mycompress() function and on
those you register with the KeyValue <A HREF = "kv_add.html">add()</A> methods.
Note that only the first value of a multi-value (or of each block of
values) passed to your mycompress() function will be aligned to the
<I>valuealign</I> <A HREF = "settings.html">setting</A>.
</P>
<P>This method is an on-processor operation, requiring no communication.
When run in parallel, each processor operates only on the key/value
pairs it stores.  Thus you are NOT compressing all values associated
with a particular key across all processors, but only those currently
owned by one processor.
