Title: MapReduce-MPI Library Users Manual
Author: Sandia National Laboratories
Abstract: The MapReduce-MPI (MR-MPI) library is open-source software that
 implements the "MapReduce operation" popularized by Google on top
 of standard MPI message passing.
 .
 The library is designed for parallel execution on distributed-memory
 platforms, but will also operate on a single processor.  It requires
 no additional software to build and run, except linking with an MPI
 library if you wish to perform MapReduces in parallel.  Similar to the
 original Google design, a user performs a MapReduce by writing a small
 program that invokes the library.  The user typically provides two
 application-specific functions, a "map()" and a "reduce()", that are
 called back from the library when a MapReduce operation is executed.
 "Map()" and "reduce()" are serial functions, meaning they are invoked
 independently on individual processors on portions of your data when
 performing a MapReduce operation in parallel.
