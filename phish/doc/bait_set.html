<P>could allow max buf size for a datum to be set
  then append switch to all launched minnows
nothing defined yet
could duplicate command-line switches to allow them
 to be set in input script
could also allow verbosity or makefile
 verbosity = 0 or 1 (default = 0) = currently not used
 makefile = filename (default = Makefile) = currently not used
   should be used to build EXE files
