This MRMPI release is a custom repackaged of MRMPI. This package does not
contains neither the upstream *.html nor the *.pdf files. Both HTML and PDF
files are regenerated from the *.txt files.

Since the documentation required a 3rd party txt2html (different from txt2html
package), we are including this single .cpp file as part of the MRMPI release.
We are building this custom txt2html during the -indep step.
