degree command :h3

[Syntax:]

degree -i in1 -o out1.file out1.mr :pre

in1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL
out1 = degree of each vertex: Key = Vi, Value = degree :ul

[Examples:]

degree -i mrv -o degree.list NULL

[Description:]

This is a named command which calculates the degree of each vertex in
an undirected graph.

See the "named command"_command.html doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.

In1 stores a set of edges, assumed to have no duplicates or self
edges.  This means that either (Vi,Vj) or (Vj,Vi) appears, but not
both.  Also (Vi,Vi) does not appear.  The input is unchanged by this
command.

Out1 will store the degree count of each vertex.
